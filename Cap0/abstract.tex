Music is an artistic form that is consumed by the whole world in large scale; and like all other source of entertainment, it is a way of transmitting information between the composer or artist and the listener. The current most know and used musical notation system for classical compositions is the sheet music and, in this system, a composition is represented in a similar way to digital signals. In this project, we present the development of a framework that is capable of processing musical compositions based on the concepts of Information Theory and identifying features from those compositions related to quantities of information that is transmitted by them. Results were obtained through analysis of several musical compositions, from classical to modern ones. Our work shows to be relevant in the field of procedural music, that is, musical compositions generated by computer software.
